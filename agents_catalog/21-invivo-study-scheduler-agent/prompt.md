I would like to create a new agent in this repository for optimizing the schedule of invivo studies in the lab. The agent must create a better schedule for invivo experiments over a 30 day period, subject to the following conditions: 1. Each study will request a number of animals for the day 2. There are a maximum of 1000 animals available per day 3. The number of studies and number of animals alloted for any given day should be close to the average across the month. 
Lab supervisors will be able to suggest better start dates for all requesting studies for a given 30 day period. You have at disposal some existing context - 1. Docker container file that can be used to setup a container with Python interfaces to solvers such as OR-Tools 2. Code example that uses OR-Tools for scheduling shifts of a set of nurses in a hospital. 
Please help me create a new Bedrock agent that can take an input number of study requests including the number of animals for a given month period and allocate these requests evenly across the month to avoid any spikes in animal and study allocations across the month. The agent should have an action group that uses a lambda function backed by the custom container to return back a optimal schedule. You can reference the following to help design the agent : 1. Powertools for AWS Lambda introduces Bedrock Agents Function utility with documentation https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/python/latest/core/event_handler/bedrock_agents/ 2. Example agent that utilizes a custom container  with a lambda function '10-SEC-10-K-agent'
