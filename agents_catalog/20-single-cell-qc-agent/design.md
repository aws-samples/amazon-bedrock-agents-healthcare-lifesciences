# Design for Single Cell QC Analysis Agent

## Architecture Overview

The Single Cell QC Analysis Agent will be implemented as an agent with two primary action groups:

1. **WebSummaryAnalyzer**: Retrieves and analyzes web summary files from S3
2. **QCValidator**: Validates metrics against technical guidelines

The agent will use AWS Lambda functions to implement these action groups, with Amazon Bedrock for document analysis.

## Component Design

### CloudFormation Template
- Defines the agent and its configuration
- Creates Lambda functions for action groups
- Sets up IAM roles with appropriate permissions
- Configures necessary CloudWatch logs

### WebSummaryAnalyzer Action Group
- Lambda function that retrieves HTML web summary files from S3
- Uses Bedrock to extract key metrics and visualizations
- Returns structured analysis of the web summary

### QCValidator Action Group
- Lambda function that compares extracted metrics against technical guidelines
- Uses Bedrock to interpret the technical document and validate metrics
- Returns validation results with explanations of any anomalies

## Data Flow

1. User provides S3 paths for web summary file and technical document
2. WebSummaryAnalyzer retrieves and analyzes the web summary file
3. QCValidator compares the analysis against technical guidelines
4. Agent returns comprehensive validation results to the user

## AWS Services Used

- **Amazon Bedrock**: Foundation model for document analysis and interpretation
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for action group implementation
- **Amazon S3**: Storage for web summary files and technical documents
- **AWS IAM**: Security and access management
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring

## Security Considerations

- Lambda functions will use IAM roles with least privilege
- S3 access limited to specific buckets and prefixes
- No sensitive data stored in logs or environment variables

## Error Handling

- Graceful handling of missing or invalid files
- Clear error messages for common failure scenarios
- Retry logic for transient failures in S3 or Bedrock API calls
