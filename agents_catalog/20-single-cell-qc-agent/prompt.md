I would like to create a new agent in this repository for quality  control analysis  of  single cell gene expression assays. This is done by comparing by retrieving the web summary file and interpreting the metrics and plots with the help of  a technical interpretation document. 
Scientists need to validate if a particular assay has any anomalies based on standard quality control measures. 
You have at disposal two example files - 1. The web summary file of the assay data that needs to be validated   and 2. The interpreter document to use to validate quality control measures 
Please help me create a new agent that can  interpret a web summary file with a given technical interpretation document. You can make assumptions that these files are available in S3. The agent should be able to retrieve and analyse a particular assay web summary file  using one action group, then validate it against a given technical document with another action group. Do not make assumptions and create additional capabilities. You can reference the following to help design the agent : 1. Powertools for AWS Lambda introduces Bedrock Function utility with documentation https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/python/latest/core/event_handler/bedrock_agents/
2. Example cloud formation template of a generated agent ’19-UniProt-protein-search-agent/uniprot-protein-search-agent-cfn.yaml ‘
3. Example agent lambda function that interprets a report using an independent bedrock converse API call to analyse the file type ’17-variant-interpreter-agent/LambdaAgent/lambda_function.py’
