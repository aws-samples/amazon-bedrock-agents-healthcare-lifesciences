# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project follows semantic versioning. Security updates are provided for the latest version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Features

### Input Sanitization
- All user inputs are sanitized using `html.escape()` to prevent XSS attacks
- Database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection
- URL parameters are properly encoded

### Infrastructure Security
- Private subnets for application containers
- Security groups with minimal required access
- IAM roles with least privilege principles
- S3 buckets with public access blocked
- VPC Flow Logs enabled for monitoring

### Container Security
- Base images from official sources
- Regular dependency updates
- Non-root user execution (where applicable)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainers directly with details
3. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. Provide any relevant logs or screenshots

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if known)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies based on severity

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy with SSL/TLS certificates
2. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for production
3. **Monitoring**: Enable CloudWatch monitoring and alerting
4. **Updates**: Keep dependencies and base images updated
5. **Secrets**: Never commit credentials or API keys

### For Development

1. **Dependencies**: Regularly audit and update dependencies
2. **Code Review**: All changes should be reviewed
3. **Testing**: Include security testing in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Scanning**: Use vulnerability scanners on container images

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

- **Demo Database**: Uses SQLite for demonstration (use RDS for production)
- **No Authentication**: Web interface has no built-in authentication
- **Public Access**: ALB allows public internet access

### Production Recommendations

- Implement AWS Cognito or similar authentication
- Use Amazon RDS with encryption at rest
- Add WAF protection for the ALB
- Implement request rate limiting
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive configuration

## Compliance

This application is designed with healthcare use cases in mind. For production deployment in healthcare environments:

- Ensure HIPAA compliance requirements are met
- Implement audit logging
- Add data encryption at rest and in transit
- Follow organizational security policies
- Conduct security assessments before deployment
