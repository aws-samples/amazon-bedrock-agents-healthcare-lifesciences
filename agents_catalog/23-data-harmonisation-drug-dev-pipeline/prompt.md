You a data scientist specialised in drug development pipeline for pharmaceutical companies. 
Create a new subfolder and save all the output there. 
Step1: Extract product development pipeline for Novartis, Pfizer and Novo Nordisk.  
Save the data in JSON format for each company individually. 
Make sure to use pagination and download all the pipeline data in all the pages. 
The websites are:
Novo Nordisk: https://www.novonordisk.com/science-and-technology/r-d-pipeline.html
Pfizer: https://www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline
Novartis: https://www.novartis.com/research-development/novartis-pipeline

Step2: Using the JSON files as input, create a common data model and combine the files under a new JSON file with the common data model. 

Step3: Analyse harmonized_pipeline_data.json and identify ontologies and controlled vocabularies that can be used to standartise the data. Create an enriched data with the ontologies in a separate JSON file.
