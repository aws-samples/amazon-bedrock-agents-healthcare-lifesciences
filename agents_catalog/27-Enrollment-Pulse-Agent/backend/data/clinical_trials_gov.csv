Several disadvantages exist with this method, the most important ones being inter- and intralesional as well as spatial heterogeneity in PD-L1 expression, as well as the need for invasive procedures to obtain material for analysis. The study hypothesis is that Positron Emission Tomography combined with Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging with a contemporary radiotracer (89Zr-atezolizumab), visualizing PD-L1 expression in the whole body, could be a better predictive biomarker to select which patients benefit from ICI.

The primary hypotheses are:

1. Olaparib plus pembrolizumab is superior to chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab with respect to progression-free survival (PFS).
2. Olaparib plus pembrolizumab is superior to chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab with respect to overall survival (OS).

This study wants to learn if small pieces of DNA associated with a tumor (called circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA) can be detected in investigational blood tests during the course of standard chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, and whether information from such investigational ctDNA blood testing could possibly be used as an early indication of chemotherapy treatment failure. It is hoped that additional information from investigational blood testing for ctDNA could help doctors to switch more quickly from a standard chemotherapy treatment that typically has significant side effects and which may not be working, to a different standard treatment regimen against TNBC, called sacituzumab govitecan. Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called hRS7, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called irinotecan. hRS7 is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as TROP2 receptors, and delivers irinotecan to kill them.

Another option for treating the patient's cancer at this point is with chemotherapy. The patient should discuss this and other options with their doctor prior to entering this study.

Laboratory studies have demonstrated that ER is actually present in some triple negative breast cancers but is ""silenced"" (does not function properly) because methyl and histone groups are attached to it and inactivate it. Special drugs called demethylating inhibitors (such as decitabine) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (such as LBH589) can remove these methyl and histone groups and reactivate ER. This reactivated ER can then be targeted with agents like tamoxifen.

NY-ESO-1 is an antigen found on the surface of many different types of tumor cells including TNBC. Antigens make it possible for immune cells to recognize and kill germ cells that invade the body, however, it is more difficult for immune cells to recognize antigens on tumor cells. T cells are a special type of immune cell in the blood. These T cells may be trained to recognize the NY-ESO-1 antigen on tumor cells, allowing the T cells to attack and kill those tumor cells. The A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells are T cells that have been removed from the patient's blood through a process called leukapheresis and then changed in the laboratory to recognize NY-ESO-1 on tumor cells. When given back to the patient, these A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells find and attack tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. They are given before the T cells to support optimum activity of the A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells. IL-2 (aldesleukin) is in a class of drugs known as cytokines. It is a man-made version of a naturally occurring protein that stimulates the body to produce other chemicals which increase the body's ability to fight cancer.

NCT05831553,TIP in Patients Affected by Metastatic TNBC,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05831553,TIP,RECRUITING,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression on cancer cells. TNBCs accounts for 15-20% of all breast cancers (BC).1 It is characterized by a worse prognosis, increased risk of metastasis to vital organs and a relative lack of therapeutic target if compared to other BC subtypes.2 Therefore, the identification of new molecular targets and therapeutic strategies is a critical need in both early and metastatic setting. TNBC appears to be more immunogenic compared to other BC6. Immunotherapy has recently changed the landscape of therapeutic options in TNBC. Recent clinical trials have shown a significant clinical benefit in patients with metastatic TNBC treated with a combination of chemotherapy and anti PD-1 agents.11-12-13-14-15 In particular, results from IMPASSION 130 trial showed a significant benefit in both progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in PD-L1 positive (PD-L1+) patients treated with a combination of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel.20 However, about 70% of PD-L1+ patients has experienced a disease progression after one year and about 50% was alive at 2 year. Moreover, no difference in survival endpoint has been seen in PD-L1 negative (PD-L1-) population, with an increase of toxicity and costs related to the addition of a checkpoint-inhibitor. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers in addition to PD-L1 and the combination of several biomarkers in a profile with higher predictive capacity is considered an area of urgent clinical need. Some immune-related features that can be identified in tumor microenvironment have been demonstrated to be independent prognostic and predictive factors: TILs, PD-L1, CD73.

1. Tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TILs) control the clinical progression of various types of cancer7. Breast cancer with higher levels of infiltrating CD8+ cytotoxic T cells have been associated with better patient survival8. Moreover, high levels of stromal CD8+ TILs (sTILs) correlate with higher probability of pCR9. Not only quantitative, but also qualitative analysis of TILs is a promising research area. Some studies suggest that different subtypes of TILs may have an opposite role in tumor microenvironment allowing the induction of both immune activating (es. CD8+) or immune suppressive (es FOXP3+) environment8-9-10.
2. The interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) represents one of the principal mechanisms of immune escape and a therapeutic target for several malignancies13-14. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction attenuates lymphocyte activation and promotes T-regulatory cell development and function, allowing to terminate the immune response15. In breast cancer the prognostic role of PD-1/PD-L1 axis is still uncertain with limited and contrasting data. PD-L1 positivity (≥1%) on immune cells (IC) is the clinical most used threshold, according to the results of IMPASSION 130 trial.18-24
3. Recently, CD73 has been identified as a possible further molecular immunosuppressive target in triple negative breast cancer28. CD73 is expressed on the surface of tumoral cells, stromal cells and immunological cells. By increasing extracellular levels of adenosine monophosphate , CD73 suppresses immune responses. CD73 has been found to be overexpressed in several types of human cancers, and it has been associated with a poor prognosis29-30-31. Particularly Loi et al demonstrated that high CD73 expression is associated with poor prognosis in TNBC and to a low rate of pathological complete response32.

We defined a tissue immune profile positive (TIP+) as the simultaneous presence of TILs≥50%, CD73≤40% and PD-L1≥1%. Any other combination was defined as TIP negative (TIP-) In conclusion, we will evaluate the association between TIP and clinical outcomes (ORR, PFS, OS).",NO,Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Tissue Immune Profile,"Progression Free Survival, After 12 months from patient enrollment, the presence of disease progression will be assessed, 12 months",Fondazione per la Medicina Personalizzata,University of Roma La Sapienza,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,100,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,FMP-2020-01-TIP,2022-09-16,2025-09-16,2025-09-16,2023-04-26,,2023-05-06,"Ospedale Santo Stefano, Prato, FI, 59100, Italy|IRCCS Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IEO, Milano, MI, 20141, Italy|Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Roma, RM, 00168, Italy|Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Policlinico Umberto I, Roma, RM, 00198, Italy|ospedale Belcolle, Viterbo, VT, 01100, Italy|Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori - Fondazione S.

However, a substantial proportion of patients do not derive benefit from this approach.

CD73 is an adenosine-generating enzyme overexpressed in several cancers and associated with poor prognosis and reduced anti-tumor immunity in TNBC. Monoclonal antibodies directed against CD73 could help to reprogram the tumor microenvironement by decreasing the adenosine mediated immunosuppression, particularly as a synergistic immunotherapeutic combination with immune checkpoint blockade.

The SYNERGY trial investigates the role of an anti-CD73 (MEDI9447) in a randomized phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin) with immunotherapy (durvalumab \[anti-PD-L1\] +/- MEDI9447 \[anti-CD73\]) in previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC.
