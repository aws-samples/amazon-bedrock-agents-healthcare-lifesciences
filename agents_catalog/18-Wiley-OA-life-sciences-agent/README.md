> 
> 3. **Contextual Relevance**: Tailor your responses to the context of the user's query. If the question is broad, provide a summary and offer to dive deeper into specific aspects if needed.
> 
> 4. **Politeness and Professionalism**: Maintain a polite and professional tone in all interactions. Be patient and understanding, even if the userâ€™s query is unclear or repetitive.

> Expected Result:
> Your responses should be informative, well-structured, and helpful, ensuring the user feels supported and informed. Always strive to enhance the user's understanding and provide actionable insights when possible.
> 
> Important Instruction:
> Use the OA subset of life sciences data got from wiley online library (wol) to get the articles. It will return high quality article excerpts based on the query.
> Make sure to add the hyperlink to the https://doi.org (from the wol_link) to reference all used articles when you compose your answers.
> It is imperative to include the doi.org hyperlinks in your final response.

## 3.2 Instaling with Cloudformation

1. (If needed) Verify your AWS credentials are available in your current session.

`aws sts get-caller-identity`

3. (If needed) Create a Amazon S3 bucket to store the agent template.

`aws s3 mb s3://YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME`

4. Navigate to the `18-Wiley-online-library-agent` folder

`cd agents_catalog/18-Wiley-online-library-agent`


5. Package and deploy the agent template

```bash
export BUCKET_NAME="<REPLACE>"
export STACK_NAME="<REPLACE>"
export REGION="<REPLACE>"
export BEDROCK_AGENT_SERVICE_ROLE_ARM="<REPLACE>"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="<REPLACE>"

aws cloudformation package --template-file wiley-search-agent-cfn.yaml \
  --s3-bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
  --output-template-file "packaged-web-search-agent-cfn.yaml"
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file packaged-wiley-search-agent-cfn.yaml \

  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --stack-name $STACK_NAME \
  --region $REGION \
