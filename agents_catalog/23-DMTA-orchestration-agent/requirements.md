## Use Cases

### UC1: Active Learning DMTA Workflow
**Actor**: Drug Discovery Scientist
**Goal**: Optimize FactorX using active learning approach
**Chat Conversation Flow**:

**User**: "Please create a project plan to optimize Cablivi (Caplacizumab) for improved vWF binding affinity"
**Agent**: Creates initial DMTA plan with active learning strategy, defines optimization objectives (KD < 1 nM)

**User**: "Start the first DMTA cycle"
**Agent**: Uses plan_cycle to generate initial compound set and experimental design

**User**: "Design nanobody variants for testing"
**Agent**: Uses plan_cycle to apply acquisition functions (EI/UCB) and select promising variants

**User**: "Execute the expression and testing"
**Agent**: Generates FactorX dummy data for expression/SPR assay phases, simulates experimental results

**User**: "Analyze the results and recommend next steps"
**Agent**: Uses analyze_results to update Gaussian Process model, identifies best variants, recommends next cycle

**Iterative Process**: Continues until convergence criteria met or optimal nanobody variant found

### UC2: Multi-Cycle Optimization
**Actor**: Medicinal Chemist
**Goal**: Achieve target properties through iterative cycles
**Steps**:
1. Review Gaussian Process model predictions
2. Apply acquisition functions for next compound selection
3. Generate FactorX SPR binding data
