Tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) consist of highly diverse leukocyte subsets with major roles in cancer immune surveillance. Due to their relatively low frequency, tumor heterogeneity, and the abundance of tissue debris in tumor samples, it is difficult to isolate or analyze TILs with sensitivity and precision. To address this challenge, we have developed a simple method for isolating CD45+ TILs from mouse tumors. Performance was evaluated in three commonly used mouse models, namely the B16-F10 (B16) melanoma, CT26.WT (CT26) colon carcinoma, and 4T1 mammary tumor models. Solid tumors were induced by subcutaneous implantation of B16, CT26, and 4T1 cancer cell lines into syngeneic recipients. The protocol can be easily modified to achieve higher purity or recovery as required, and accomodates a wide range of sample sizes. Importantly, major immune subsets including T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells are recovered after isolation. EasySepᵀ Mouse TIL (CD45) Positive Selection Kit allows researchers to isolate leukocytes from tumors with ease, improving the TIL downstream workflow. Furthering our understanding of TILs will be essential for developing effective immunotherapeutic strategies.\\\\n\\\\n## METHODS\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\*Mix Component A, B, and C at a 1:1:6 ratio\\\\n\\\\nFIGURE 1.

Tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) consist of highly diverse leukocyte subsets with major roles in cancer immune surveillance. Due to their relatively low frequency, tumor heterogeneity, and the abundance of tissue debris in tumor samples, it is difficult to isolate or analyze TILs with sensitivity and precision. To address this challenge, we have developed a simple method for isolating CD45+ TILs from mouse tumors. Performance was evaluated in three commonly used mouse models, namely the B16-F10 (B16) melanoma, CT26.WT (CT26) colon carcinoma, and 4T1 mammary tumor models. Solid tumors were induced by subcutaneous implantation of B16, CT26, and 4T1 cancer cell lines into syngeneic recipients. The protocol can be easily modified to achieve higher purity or recovery as required, and accomodates a wide range of sample sizes. Importantly, major immune subsets including T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells are recovered after isolation. EasySepᵀ Mouse TIL (CD45) Positive Selection Kit allows researchers to isolate leukocytes from tumors with ease, improving the TIL downstream workflow. Furthering our understanding of TILs will be essential for developing effective immunotherapeutic strategies.\"\\n        },\\n        \"sub_type\": \"PARAGRAPH\"\\n      },\\n      {\\n        \"type\": \"TEXT\",\\n        \"id\": \"ca464d75-7a4b-4707-9621-73dff0752e53\",\\n        \"reading_order\": 5,\\n        \"page_indices\": [\\n          0\\n        ],\\n        \"representation\": {\\n          \"markdown\": \"## METHODS\"\\n        },\\n        \"sub_type\": \"SECTION_HEADER\"\\n      },\\n      {\\n        \"type\": \"TEXT\",\\n        \"id\": \"d4cba0bd-e0ef-4fe6-87ac-5630dae50521\",\\n        \"reading_order\": 6,\\n        \"page_indices\": [\\n          0\\n        ],\\n        \"representation\": {\\n          \"markdown\": \"\\\\\\\\*Mix Component A, B, and C at a 1:1:6 ratio\\\\n\\\\nFIGURE 1.

Eaves¹,², Sharon A. Louis1, and Frann Antignano¹\\n\\nSTEMCELL Technologies Inc., Vancouver BC, Canada; ²Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver BC, Canada\\n\\n## INTRODUCTION\\n\\nCell-based immunotherapy is being evaluated in various types of cancer and it is one of the most rapidly growing and promising areas of cancer research. Tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) consist of highly diverse leukocyte subsets with major roles in cancer immune surveillance. Due to their relatively low frequency, tumor heterogeneity, and the abundance of tissue debris in tumor samples, it is difficult to isolate or analyze TILs with sensitivity and precision. To address this challenge, we have developed a simple method for isolating CD45+ TILs from mouse tumors. Performance was evaluated in three commonly used mouse models, namely the B16-F10 (B16) melanoma, CT26.WT (CT26) colon carcinoma, and 4T1 mammary tumor models. Solid tumors were induced by subcutaneous implantation of B16, CT26, and 4T1 cancer cell lines into syngeneic recipients. The protocol can be easily modified to achieve higher purity or recovery as required, and accomodates a wide range of sample sizes. Importantly, major immune subsets including T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells are recovered after isolation. EasySepᵀ Mouse TIL (CD45) Positive Selection Kit allows researchers to isolate leukocytes from tumors with ease, improving the TIL downstream workflow. Furthering our understanding of TILs will be essential for developing effective immunotherapeutic strategies.\\n\\n## METHODS\\n\\n\\\\*Mix Component A, B, and C at a 1:1:6 ratio\\n\\nFIGURE 1.

      "          \"markdown\": \"Cell-based immunotherapy is being evaluated in various types of cancer and it is one of the most rapidly growing and promising areas of cancer research. Tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) consist of highly diverse leukocyte subsets with major roles in cancer immune surveillance. Due to their relatively low frequency, tumor heterogeneity, and the abundance of tissue debris in tumor samples, it is difficult to isolate or analyze TILs with sensitivity and precision. To address this challenge, we have developed a simple method for isolating CD45+ TILs from mouse tumors. Performance was evaluated in three commonly used mouse models, namely the B16-F10 (B16) melanoma, CT26.WT (CT26) colon carcinoma, and 4T1 mammary tumor models. Solid tumors were induced by subcutaneous implantation of B16, CT26, and 4T1 cancer cell lines into syngeneic recipients. The protocol can be easily modified to achieve higher purity or recovery as required, and accomodates a wide range of sample sizes. Importantly, major immune subsets including T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells are recovered after isolation. EasySepᵀ Mouse TIL (CD45) Positive Selection Kit allows researchers to isolate leukocytes from tumors with ease, improving the TIL downstream workflow. Furthering our understanding of TILs will be essential for developing effective immunotherapeutic strategies.\"\n",
