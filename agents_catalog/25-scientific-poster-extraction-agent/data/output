## Introduction
Cell-based immunotherapy is being evaluated in various types of cancer and it is one of the most rapidly growing and promising areas of cancer research. Tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) consist of highly diverse leukocyte subsets with major roles in cancer immune surveillance. Due to their relatively low frequency, tumor heterogeneity, and the abundance of tissue debris in tumor samples, it is difficult to isolate or analyze TILs with sensitivity and precision. To address this challenge, we have developed a simple method for isolating CD45+ TILs from mouse tumors. Performance was evaluated in three commonly used mouse models, namely the B16-F10 (B16) melanoma, CT26.WT (CT26) colon carcinoma, and 4T1 mammary tumor models. Solid tumors were induced by subcutaneous implantation of B16, CT26, and 4T1 cancer cell lines into syngeneic recipients.

## Methods
The protocol uses EasySep™ Mouse TIL (CD45) Positive Selection Kit and involves the following steps:
1. Prepare EasySep™ TIL (CD45) Positive Selection Cocktail (Components A, B, and C mixed at 1:1:6 ratio)
2. Add EasySep™ TIL (CD45) Positive Selection Cocktail
3. Incubate for 3 minutes
4. Add EasySep™ Dextran RapidSpheres™
5. Incubate for 5 minutes
6. Place tube in magnet
7. Incubate for 5 minutes
8. Discard pour-off
9. Top up with EasySep™ Buffer
10. Repeat magnetic separation 4 times (5 minutes each)
11. Collect CD45+ TILs from EasySep™ Magnet

## Results
1. CD45+ TIL purity after isolation:
   - B16: 92.8%
   - CT26: 73.3%
   - 4T1: 83.2%

2. Performance variations with different parameters:
   - Start cell concentration affects purity (85.7-96.1% at different concentrations)
   - Start volume impacts recovery (37.3-57.0% across different volumes)
   - Compatible with various EasySep™ magnets (Purple, Silver, and EasyEights™)

3. Immune cell composition is maintained after isolation (demonstrated through flow cytometry)

## Summary
- EasySep™ Mouse TIL (CD45) Positive Selection Kit enables isolation of leukocytes from solid tumors in as little as 30 minutes, achieving purity as high as 98%
- The isolation protocol can accommodate different sample volumes and cell densities due to tumor tissue heterogeneity
- TIL purity or recovery can be optimized by adjusting the starting cell concentration or volume
- TIL immune cell composition of the starting sample is maintained following EasySep™ isolation
