# Requirements for Safety Signal Detection Agent

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Adverse Event Analysis Capability

- The agent must analyze adverse events using the OpenFDA API
- Analysis should include trend analysis over specified time periods (default: 6 months)
- Support filtering by product name and reporting period
- Analysis should provide:
  - Time series trend of report numbers
  - Top 10 adverse events by severity
  - Statistical signal detection using PRR (Proportional Reporting Ratio)
- Results should be presented in a clear, summarized format

### FR2: Evidence Assessment

- The agent must evaluate detected signals through:
  - PubMed literature search and summary
  - FDA label information retrieval
  - Basic biological plausibility assessment
- Retrieved information should include:
  - Relevant publication summaries
  - Current label status of the adverse event
  - Preliminary causality assessment

### FR3: Report Generation

- The agent should generate standardized reports including:
  - Analysis summary
  - Signal detection results
  - Evidence summary
  - Recommended actions
- Reports should be clear and scientifically accurate

### FR4: API Integration

- Integration with OpenFDA API for adverse event data
- Integration with PubMed API for literature search
- Integration with FDA Label API for product information
- Proper error handling for all API interactions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance

- API calls should complete within reasonable time limits (< 60 seconds)
- The agent should handle rate limiting from APIs gracefully
- Analysis results should be returned efficiently

### NFR2: Reliability

- The agent should handle API errors gracefully
- Invalid product names should be handled with appropriate error messages
- Network failures should be handled with retry logic where appropriate

### NFR3: Security

- Proper handling of public health data
- Standard AWS security practices for Lambda functions
- Appropriate IAM roles and permissions

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: AWS Infrastructure

- Amazon Bedrock Agent with appropriate model
- AWS Lambda functions for action groups
- CloudFormation template for infrastructure deployment
- Required IAM roles and policies

### TR2: API Requirements

- HTTP client for multiple API interactions
- JSON parsing for API responses
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Proper HTTP headers and user agent strings

## Use Cases

### UC1: Regular Safety Signal Detection

**Actor**: Medical Affairs Professional
**Goal**: Detect and evaluate new safety signals
**Steps**:

1. User requests safety signal analysis for a product
2. Agent performs adverse event analysis
3. Agent detects potential signals
4. Agent gathers supporting evidence
5. Agent generates comprehensive report

### UC2: Signal Evidence Assessment

**Actor**: Safety Evaluator
**Goal**: Evaluate evidence for detected signals
**Steps**:

1. User requests detailed information about specific signal
2. Agent searches literature and label information
3. Agent presents evidence summary
4. Agent provides preliminary assessment

## Constraints

### C1: API Limitations

- Must respect API rate limits and usage policies
- Limited to publicly available data
- Dependent on multiple API availabilities

### C2: Data Limitations

- Limited to publicly reported adverse events
- Potential reporting biases in source data
- Variable quality of evidence in literature

### C3: Analysis Limitations

- Focus on statistical signal detection
- Basic causality assessment only
- Preliminary recommendations require expert review
