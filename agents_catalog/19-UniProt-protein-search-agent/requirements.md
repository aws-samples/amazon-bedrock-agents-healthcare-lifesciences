# Requirements for UniProt Protein Search Agent

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Protein Search Capability

- The agent must be able to search for proteins using the UniProt search API
- Search should support protein names, gene names, descriptions, and disease associations
- Search should allow filtering by organism (defaulting to human)
- Search results should include UniProt accession IDs and basic protein information
- Search should be limited to a reasonable number of results (max 50, default 10)

### FR2: Protein Detail Retrieval

- The agent must retrieve comprehensive protein information using UniProtKB accession IDs
- Retrieved information should include:
  - Protein function and description
  - Subcellular localization
  - Disease associations
  - Gene names and synonyms
  - Protein features and domains
  - Amino acid sequence (optional)
  - Cross-references to other databases

### FR3: User Interaction

- The agent should understand natural language queries about proteins
- The agent should guide users through the search and retrieval process
- The agent should present information in a clear, scientifically accurate manner
- The agent should be able to answer questions like "Which protein might cause disease X?"

### FR4: API Integration

- Integration with UniProt REST API (<https://rest.uniprot.org/>)
- Support for UniProt search endpoint for protein discovery
- Support for UniProt entry retrieval endpoint for detailed information
- Proper error handling for API failures or invalid queries

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance

- API calls should complete within reasonable time limits (< 30 seconds)
- The agent should handle rate limiting from UniProt API gracefully
- Search results should be returned efficiently

### NFR2: Reliability

- The agent should handle API errors gracefully
- Invalid accession IDs should be handled with appropriate error messages
- Network failures should be handled with retry logic where appropriate

### NFR3: Security

- No sensitive data storage requirements (UniProt is public data)
- Standard AWS security practices for Lambda functions
- Proper IAM roles and permissions

### NFR4: Maintainability

- Code should follow Python best practices
- Clear error messages and logging
- Modular design for easy updates to API integration

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: AWS Infrastructure

- Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 model
- AWS Lambda functions for action groups
- CloudFormation template for infrastructure deployment
- Appropriate IAM roles and policies

### TR2: API Requirements

- HTTP client for UniProt REST API calls
- JSON parsing for API responses
- URL encoding for search queries
- Proper HTTP headers and user agent strings

### TR3: Data Format Requirements

- Support for UniProt's JSON response format
- Ability to parse and extract relevant protein information
- Proper handling of optional fields in API responses

## Use Cases

### UC1: Disease-Related Protein Discovery

**Actor**: Researcher
**Goal**: Find proteins associated with a specific disease
**Steps**:

1. User asks "What proteins are associated with [disease name]?"
2. Agent searches UniProt for disease-related proteins
3. Agent presents search results with protein names and accession IDs
4. User selects proteins of interest
5. Agent retrieves detailed information for selected proteins

### UC2: Specific Protein Analysis

**Actor**: Scientist
**Goal**: Get comprehensive information about a known protein
**Steps**:

1. User asks about a specific protein by name
2. Agent searches for the protein to find its accession ID
3. Agent retrieves detailed protein information
4. Agent presents function, location, and other relevant data

### UC3: Functional Protein Search

**Actor**: Researcher
**Goal**: Find proteins with specific functions or locations
**Steps**:

1. User asks about proteins with specific characteristics
2. Agent searches using functional or localization terms
3. Agent presents matching proteins
4. User can request details for specific proteins of interest

## Constraints

### C1: API Limitations

- Must respect UniProt API rate limits and usage policies
- Limited to publicly available UniProt data
- Dependent on UniProt API availability and performance

### C2: AWS Limitations

- Lambda function timeout limits
- Memory constraints for large protein sequences
- CloudFormation template size limits

### C3: Data Limitations

- Information accuracy depends on UniProt database curation
- Some proteins may have limited annotation
- Cross-references may not always be available
