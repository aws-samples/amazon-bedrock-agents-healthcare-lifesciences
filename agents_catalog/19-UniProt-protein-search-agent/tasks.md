## Validation Checklist

### Functional Validation

- [ ] Agent can search for proteins by name
- [ ] Agent can search for proteins by disease association
- [ ] Agent can filter results by organism
- [ ] Agent can retrieve detailed protein information by accession ID
- [ ] Agent handles invalid queries gracefully
- [ ] Agent provides scientifically accurate responses

### Technical Validation

- [ ] CloudFormation template deploys successfully
- [ ] Lambda functions execute without errors
- [ ] API calls to UniProt complete successfully
- [ ] Error handling works for various failure scenarios
- [ ] Logging provides adequate debugging information
- [ ] IAM permissions follow least privilege principle

### User Experience Validation

- [ ] Agent responses are clear and informative
- [ ] Agent guides users through multi-step workflows
- [ ] Agent provides appropriate biological context
- [ ] Agent handles ambiguous queries appropriately
- [ ] Agent suggests next steps when relevant

## Notes

- Each completed task should be followed by a git commit
- Test thoroughly with real UniProt API before marking tasks complete
- Ensure all code follows Python best practices and includes proper error handling
- Validate that the agent works with the specified Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 model
