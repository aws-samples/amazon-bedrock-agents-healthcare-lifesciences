- [x] Test agent interactions through AWS Console
- [x] Validate protein search functionality end-to-end
- [x] Validate protein details retrieval end-to-end
- [x] Test error handling scenarios
- [x] Test with various protein queries and organisms

## Phase 6: Documentation and Examples

- [x] Update README.md with complete usage examples
- [x] Add example queries and expected responses
- [x] Document common use cases and workflows
- [x] Create troubleshooting section
- [x] Add API rate limiting and best practices documentation
- [ ] Create example Jupyter notebook (optional)

## Phase 7: Quality Assurance

- [ ] Performance testing with various query types
- [ ] Validate against UniProt API documentation
- [ ] Test deployment in clean AWS environment
- [ ] Verify all CloudFormation parameters work correctly
- [ ] Test cleanup and stack deletion

## Phase 8: Final Integration

- [x] Test integration with main toolkit infrastructure
- [ ] Verify agent appears in React UI (if applicable)
- [x] Update main repository documentation
- [ ] Create pull request with complete implementation
- [ ] Address any code review feedback

## Validation Checklist

### Functional Validation

- [x] Agent can search for proteins by name
- [x] Agent can search for proteins by disease association
- [x] Agent can filter results by organism
- [x] Agent can retrieve detailed protein information by accession ID
- [x] Agent handles invalid queries gracefully
- [x] Agent provides scientifically accurate responses

### Technical Validation

- [x] CloudFormation template deploys successfully
- [x] Lambda functions execute without errors
- [x] API calls to UniProt complete successfully
- [x] Error handling works for various failure scenarios
- [x] Logging provides adequate debugging information
- [x] IAM permissions follow least privilege principle

### User Experience Validation

- [x] Agent responses are clear and informative
- [x] Agent guides users through multi-step workflows
- [x] Agent provides appropriate biological context
- [x] Agent handles ambiguous queries appropriately
- [x] Agent suggests next steps when relevant

## Notes

- Each completed task should be followed by a git commit
- Test thoroughly with real UniProt API before marking tasks complete
- Ensure all code follows Python best practices and includes proper error handling
- Validate that the agent works with the specified Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 model
