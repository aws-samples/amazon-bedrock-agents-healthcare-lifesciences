# Cancer Biomarker Discovery with Strands Agents and Bedrock AgentCore

This implementation demonstrates how to replicate the cancer biomarker discovery multi-agent system using Strands agents and deployment with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

## Architecture Overview

![architecture](images/Biomarker_agents_Strands_AgentCore.png)

The **Strands Orchestrator Agent** implements the [Agent as Tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/multi-agent/agents-as-tools/) concept proposed by Strands Agents framework by defining the specialized agents below as tools.

## Specialized Agents

### 1. Biomarker Database Analyst
- **Tools**: `get_database_schema`, `query_biomarker_database`, `refine_sql_query`
- **Capabilities**: SQL generation, database queries, schema analysis

### 2. Clinical Evidence Researcher
- **Tools**: `search_pubmed`
- **Capabilities**: Literature search, evidence synthesis, citation analysis

### 3. Medical Imaging Expert
- **Tools**: `process_medical_images`
- **Capabilities**: Image processing, radiomics analysis, biomarker extraction

### 4. Statistician Agent  
- **Tools**: `perform_survival_analysis`, `create_bar_chart`
- **Capabilities**: Survival analysis, statistical modeling, data visualization

## Prerequisites

1. These notebooks were designed to run with Amazon SageMaker Studio. To use Studio, you will need to set up a SageMaker Domain. For instructions on how to onboard to a SageMaker domain, refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-studio-onboard.html).

2. With the SageMaker domain created, you have to create a **JupyterLab space**. We recommend an instance size of **ml.t3.large** and at least **50 GB** of storage.

3. If you are running the notebooks locally, make sure you have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed in your environment.

## Setup Instructions

The infrastructure deployment is required to run the notebooks in step 2, but the Streamlit UI is optional.

### 1. Deploy Infrastructure

Run the following command to deploy all the infrastructure components needed for the agents:

```bash
# Deploy the provided CloudFormation stack (no changes needed)
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file Infra_cfn.yaml --stack-name biomarker-agentcore
```

The tempalte will create the following resources in your AWS account:
- VPC with 2 private subnets, 1 public subnet and a NAT gateway and an Internet gateway
- Redshift database
- S3 buckets for data and logs
- Lambda functions to provision custom resources, data processing, and populating the database
- ECR repositories
- CodeBuild projects to create custom container images
- Step Function to process medical images
- Bedrock Knowledge Base
- AgentCore and SageMaker execution roles

### 2. Notebooks

The sample notebooks will explore how agentic workflows powered by [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/) framework and large language models on Amazon Bedrock can enhance complex oncology research. You will learn how AI-driven agents leverage planning, tool-use, and self-reflection, to transform intricate research queries into actionable insights. You will also learn how to deploy the agents on [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) Runtime.

1. Clone this repository or manually import all files from this project into your JupyterLab workspace.
2. To setup the environment, first run the notebook [00-setup_environment.ipynb](00-setup_environment.ipynb).
3. Notebooks 1 to 5 are typically executed in order, but you can also run them independently. You also have the option to skip to notebook [05-multi_agent_biomarker_strands](05-multi_agent_biomarker_strands.ipynb) to create the orchestrator agent and deploy it on Bedrock AgentCore.
4. Follow the instructions on each notebook to run the cells. Some of the notebooks will have a Setup section in the beginning with additional installation instructions.

### 3. User Interface

We also provide a Streamlit UI that can be used as a front end for your agents. To execute the UI locally, you'll need to install Streamlit on your local Python environment. You can do that by running the following command (assuming you are running from the folder where this README is located):

```bash
pip install -r ui/requirements.txt
```

To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command from the same path:

```bash
streamlit run ui/app.py -- --env env1
```

The Streamlit application will load on your default web browser and it typically runs on ```http://localhost:8501/```
