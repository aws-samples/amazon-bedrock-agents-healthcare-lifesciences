I would like to create a new agent in this repository for retrieving information about proteins from UniProt. Scientists need information about specific proteins to answer questions like, "Which protein might be the cause of a disease"? This information could include human-readable descriptions of protein function, metadata about where a protein is commonly located in a cell, or amino acid sequence information. UniProt provides several APIs to retrieve information about proteins programmatically. An overview of these APIs can be found at https://www.uniprot.org/api-documentation/uniprotkb. You can also find detailed Swagger documentation for these APIs at https://www.uniprot.org/api-documentation/uniprotkb.  Please help me create a new Bedrock Agent that can take in the name or description of a protein, search for it using an ActionGroup linked to the UniProt search API, then retrieve details for one or more specific proteins of
 interest by their UniProtKB accession ID.
